subtitle: Sophia - CS 103 Student
---

My name is Sophia, and I'm a student at Williams College. I'm originally from Newark, NJ. I am part of the course Computer Science 103: _Electronic Textiles_. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge about programing and getting creative with the final project! This is the website I will be using to update my work for this class. Thank you for visiting it!

### Why I'm Here

I am very interested in interdisciplinary studies, which is why I got drawn to this class.
I wanted the chance to learn useful programming skills but also combine it with the other useful skill of sewing. This activity allows you to learn and create. I was very drawn to the goal of this class and what it could do for me. I would be able to gain real world skills and hopefully I can reproduce them in the future. This class is giving me the opportunity to go out of my comfort zone in more ways than one. That is exactly what I wanted to experience with my liberal arts education.
Doing new things and having fun with them!
To keep up to date with my progress and projects, keep coming back here. Thank you for reading, and have a wonderful day!
