My final project is the Peter Pan Play Pad!
It functions as an interactive tapestry perfect for anyone from young children to play with to older generations who want magic in their home.
The design has multiple functions that make it interactive:
The Big Ben dings everytime the clockhands are touching,
the Second Star to the Right shines various colors depending on what buttons are being pressed,
and Tinkerbell appears with some of her pixie dust when it gets dark!

I was inspired as a fan of the film to create this project.
I wanted to have something interactive and I felt that this decoration would be very fun to have!

Materials:
1) Brown, black, red, green, dark blue, light blue, and muslin fabric
2) Markers, pencil, and tape
3) Yellow, pink, purple, light green, and blue thread and embroidery floss
4) Conductive thread patches and insulation foam
5) 8 yellow LEDs
6) Lilypad USB Plus
7) Scissors and fabric scissors
8) Lilypad off-board RGB LED, light sensor, buzzer, and rechargable battery
9) Alligator clips
10) Various sizes of sewing needles

Here is the revised Paper Prototype of my project.
I updated any previous mistakes and tried to correspond the pins to what my project actually uses.
This is why you see some "overlapping threads" because the prototype is slightly different from how the project actually looks.

Next is a picture of my working alligator clip prototype before I sewed everything together.

One tip I would give myself is never underestimate the sewing.
Throughout this semester I've been really good at getting my projects to work.
I thought that my main challenge would just be how long it would take to sew, but I was actually having trouble getting my project to work once I sewed everything.
I would practice sewing more and not underestimate the difficulty of it.
The next tip would be to remember that inputs and outputs should not share a pin.
I made the mistake of drawing this on my first paper prototype but was reminded that this would not be a good idea.
My third tip is to keep at most 3 LEDs per pin, because any more could create a power loss that would affect the circuit.
