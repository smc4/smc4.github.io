My final project is the Peter Pan Play Pad!
It functions as an interactive tapestry perfect for anyone from young children to play with to older generations who want magic in their home.
The design has multiple functions that make it interactive:
The Big Ben dings everytime the clockhands are touching,
the Second Star to the Right shines various colors depending on what buttons are being pressed,
and Tinkerbell appears with some of her pixie dust when it gets dark!

I was inspired as a fan of the film to create this project.
I wanted to have something interactive and I felt that this decoration would be very fun to have!

Materials:
1) Brown, black, red, green, dark blue, light blue, and muslin fabric
2) Markers, pencil, and tape
3) Yellow, pink, purple, light green, and blue thread and embroidery floss
4) Conductive thread patches and insulation foam
5) 8 yellow LEDs
6) Lilypad USB Plus
7) Scissors and fabric scissors
8) Lilypad off-board RGB LED, light sensor, buzzer, and rechargable battery
9) Alligator clips
10) Various sizes of sewing needles

Here is the revised Paper Prototype of my project.
I updated any previous mistakes and tried to correspond the pins to what my project actually uses.
This is why you see some "overlapping threads" because the prototype is slightly different from how the project actually looks.

Next is a picture of my working alligator clip prototype before I sewed everything together.

If I could give myself advice when I was starting this, it would be to maybe plan out what I want to do first and then put it into code.
Sometimes it can be hard to translate English into the language of c, so make it easier on yourself by picturing what you want first and then programming that.
