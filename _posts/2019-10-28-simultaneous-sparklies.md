This assignment required us to take the different patterns of our previous assignment so that all the lights would start flashing at the same time.
The picture below presents the three different LEDs that were lit up by the different patterns we programmed.

The biggest take away I got from this was the importance of if statement placement.
Most of my code worked until I got to the big dipper firefly.
It took me a very long time to realize that I had placed an if statement within another, which caused the lights to behave in a way I did not want.
Basically, make your placement intentional.
While it is okay to experiment with code while trying to figure it out, just go through it out loud to visualize what is actually going on.
This can really help you in the long run like it helped me.
