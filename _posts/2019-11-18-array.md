This assignment had us use an array to work with the PWM pins on our Arduino boards.
The goal was to randomly pick a pin within the array and turn on that LED to a random brightness.
If the randomly selected pin is already on, it should be turned off until the next time it's picked.

I made the mistake of what variables I used in my code.
I wanted to use an if statement that checked if the randomly chosen pin was off.
To do this I originally wrote something along the lines of "if random pin is false".
However, this would only be true if the pin selected was stored in the array in place 0.
I realized by reading my code out loud that what I really needed to do was say that if the state for random pin was false then I wanted it to do something.
By figuring this out I was able to fix my mistake so that it worked as intended.
