title: Homemade Switch Assignment

This assignment required us to practice making homemade switches through prototype planning.
We had to make paper prototypes and alligator prototypes of what these circuits would look like.
Our final product had to be a circuit that included an LED, a battery, conductive thread, and two switches.
The first kind of switch is made of conductive thread patches.
You have to use satin stitch on one side of the fabric to make two different patches out of conductive thread.
When these patches are touched together, they should work with the other switch to turn the light on.
The other switch is a conductive thread patch.
For my design, I sewed conductive thread into it and used regular thread to keep it in place.
I then sewed conductive thread next to it so that, when I touch them together, they help close the circuit.

A tip I might give my past self for completing this would be to consider size when prototyping.
It is easier to place things where I want on paper, but then I have to consider the real sizes of what I am working with.
Thus, my final product has different placement from my prototype that I was not anticipating.
