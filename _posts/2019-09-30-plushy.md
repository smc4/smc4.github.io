This project was about practicing prototyping and programming circuits. The assignment started out with making paper prototypes for various circuit situations. Once we did a paper prototype for them, we had to make a larger prototype using alligator clips. One of these examples was turned into a real life creation. We took example circuit 4 and had to sew it onto a plushy using conductive thread. The end result is supposed to have three LED lights controlled by both a switch and button.

The final product can be seen through these pictures. One tip I would offer would be to remember that the button and switch are both capable of causing an open circuit when they are not turned on. This means that the thread on either side of these devices should not be connected. This can cause everything to light up whether or not the button or switch are turned on.
