For this assignment, we had to practice using if...else statements on C.
To do this, we had to work with the integer variable temperature.
I put conditions that had to be met by specific temperature inputs, and the output would be a statement about clothing suggestions for that particular temperature.

If I could give myself advice when I was starting this, it would be to maybe plan out what I want to do first and then put it into code.
Sometimes it can be hard to translate English into the language of c, so make it easier on yourself by picturing what you want first and then programming that.
