This assignment required us to practice using nested if statements.
To do that, we had to come up with code that determined whether customer ordered from the regular menu by picking an even number
or from the secret menu by picking an odd number. 
Then, once the customer has chosen their menu, they pick one of three options from their chosen menu.
Since not all customers should know there is a secret menu, the output only displays the food that the person ordered.
If they pick anything other than the three options on the menu, a message will let them know that there is only three options
and kindly ask them to pick one of those.

This is the output for my code:
![Menu Output](/img/IMG_9925.JPG){: .center-block :}

A tip I might give my past self for completing this would be to look at the curvy brackets!
Make sure you are placing code in the right places relative to these brackets.
You can finally figure out the right code, but if code is in the wrong place then it won't run!
