This assignment required us to practice using nested if statements based on our Plushy assignment.
To do that, we had to assign variables to the button, switch, and three LED lights.
I showed that when both the button and switch are on, all three LEDs are on and print on.
When either the button and/or the switch are off, all three LEDs are off and print off.
An example of this can be seen in my output.

A tip I might give my past self for completing this would be that nested ifs can go inside the if part of an if else statement.
I thought they could only go in the else section, but as long as the nested if is somewhere in there it will work.
