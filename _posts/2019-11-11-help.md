This assignment involved using the off-board vibrator.
We had to test it out using morse code so that the vibrations would create messages.
We made an alligator clip switch so that when the circuit was closed the vibrator would signal SOS.
When the circuit was open, it vibrated my name in morse code.

One tip I would pass on would be to remember things like delay and digitalWrite for the switch.
I had the various delay parameters set up using the variables I created but had forgot to actually declare "delay(etc)".
I also forgot to include digitalWrite in my void setup for the switch pin so that the current would go through.
These are crucial to getting erverything to work, even if the rest of your code and Lilypad setup is right.
