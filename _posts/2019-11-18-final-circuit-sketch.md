This picture shows my circuit diagram for my final project.
This will help me get a sense of what I will need to be connecting when I begin creating the product.
This will help me see where there might be overlapping of wires and take into account placement on the tapestry.

Imagining the pieces of the Arduino off of the board helped me to better understand how they work.
I already know how to use them in programming, but I was a little confused when it came to connecting the pieces once they're disconnected
Now I have a better understanding and can approach the project better informed.
