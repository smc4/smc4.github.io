Hello! My name is Sophia Clement. I am a sophomore and potential American Studies major. I do not have any sewing experience, and my programming experience is limited to some html that i learned in senior year of high school for my Web Design course. In this class, I'm hoping to learn more about both of these things and how they can be used towards creative projects! One boring fact about me is that I have a red birthmark on my right pinky finger.
