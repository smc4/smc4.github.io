title: Testing While Loops with LED Colors
tags: [programming, beginner]
---

The goal for this assignment was to practice using while loops as if we were programming LEDs.
The output of the code should be the word "RED" printed three times in a row, every ten times through the loop.
The same for green and blue following this.
Ideally, the code would reset after blue to go back to red then green then blue again and again.
We want the code to work for any number of loops and be able to follow this pattern consistently.
The following picture is my output for a run time of 140 loops.

If I could give myself advice when I was starting this, it would be to make sure that my program can repeat itself.
My first time trying this, I found a solution but it only worked on a small scale.
If I had wanted the pattern to repeat for many numbers it would have required much more code than I ended up using.
Basically, always be looking for an easier way to code!!
