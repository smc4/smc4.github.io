This is my sewing sampler!

My tip to myself would be to always think simple!
I tried to emulate the last assignment in many ways so I originally included a boolean value and had an else if statement.
In that else if I also said that it had to be warm AND light to turn the detector off, when really it just has to be either.
This is when I realized that all I needed was an else to make it easier.
