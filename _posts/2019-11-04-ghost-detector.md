This assignment was our first step in becoming Ghost Busters: making our very own Ghost Detectors! We programmed our Arduino boards to turn on the red lights when the proper conditions for cold and dark are met. The lights should turn on only when both occur. We were able to practice using the temperature and light sensors with this assignment.

My tip to myself would be to always think simple!
I tried to emulate the last assignment in many ways so I originally included a boolean value and had an else if statement.
In that else if I also said that it had to be warm AND light to turn the detector off, when really it just has to be either.
This is when I realized that all I needed was an else to make it easier.
