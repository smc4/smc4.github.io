This is my sewing sampler!
![Sampler](/img/IMG_9925.JPG){: .center-block :}

Starting from the top and going clockwise, I have a whip stitch, cross stitch, french knot stitch, satin stitch, pick stitch, blanket stitch, and back stitch.
If I could go back and give myself advice, it might be to make sure that I pull the string all the way through before I keep going.
This gave me lots of problems during my satin stitch.
