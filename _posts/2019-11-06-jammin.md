This project required us to work with the buzzer on our Arduino Lilypad USB Plus.
We had to find a pre-made file of music that could be played by our buzzer.
Then, this music had to be controlled by a switch.
The music should only play when the switch is on and not make any noise otherwise.

A tip to myself would be to remember digitalWrite.
I remembered to include digitalRead in the loop, but digitalWrite is needed in the setup.
I also learned that to make the music work I needed a for loop.
I had tried making my own music based off of a previous arrangement I had done, but I did not know enough for it to work.
It was easier for me to just get a pre-made for loop from the internet and manipulate that.
